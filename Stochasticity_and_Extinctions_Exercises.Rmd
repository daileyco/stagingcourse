For this module, work through **two** DSAIDE apps, namely _Stochastic SIRS Model_ and _Stochastic SEIR Model_. Fill and submit the corresponding quiz sheets.


# Topic discussion 

Read the paper “Measles Endemicity in Insular Populations: Critical Community Size and Its Evolutionary Implication” by Black (1966), which you can get [here](./media/black66jtb.pdf). The paper discusses critical community size for measles. Find a paper that discusses the idea of critical community size for a different infectious disease. Read, summarize and critique the papers.

Post your write-up to the discussion channel, then respond to posts by others. The general rules for discussion and assessment apply.
