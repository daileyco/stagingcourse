# Topic discussion 

Read the paper "How should pathogen transmission be modelled?" by McCallum et al. (2001) which you can get [here](./media/mccallum01tree.pdf). The authors discuss different models for (direct) transmission. They claim that it matters in a practical setting to get the transmission term right. Pick some ID and explain how different assumptions about transmission might lead to different conclusions concerning possible control strategies.
