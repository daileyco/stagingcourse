# Overview
In this module, we will continue the discussion of the reproductive number. 


# Reading

I suggest that after having worked through the material from the previous module, you do another read-through of the ["Reproductive Number" chapter of IDEMAB](https://andreashandel.github.io/IDEMAbook/R0.html). Some of that material might require more than one reading for it to sink in.

Next, for something topical, read [this paper by Sarah Cobey](./media/cobey20science.pdf) in which she provides a brief discussion of infectious disease modeling and the role the reproductive number plays related to COVID-19. She also touches on topics we covered in previous modules (e.g. seasonality).


# Videos

The following videos discuss some further aspects of the reproductive number.

## Another explanation of the reproductive number 
In the following video, Joseph Wu from the University of Hong Kong provides another explanation of the reproductive number. He also briefly explains another important quantity to characterize transmission, the secondary attack ratio (it's not a rate and should therefore not be called that, but often it is, like in this video).

## Reproductive number and vaccination
In this video from the ["Epidemics MOOC"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics), Matt discusses the relation between the reproductive number and vaccination. We will discuss vaccination and other control strategies at some later point in more detail.

## Reproductive number and force/age of infection
This video, again from the ["Epidemics MOOC"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics), discusses the connection between the reproductive number and the force and age of infection.
