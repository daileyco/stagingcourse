# Overview
In this module, we will discuss different types of transmission and then focus on direct transmission, and how this affects ID dynamics. 


# Learning Outcomes

In this module, you will learn to:

* Assess how different modes of direct transmission affect ID dynamics.

* Contrast the difference between density- and frequency-dependent transmission.

* Predict how population size impacts ID dynamics for different types of transmission. 


# Reading

Read the chapters ["Types of infectious disease transmission"](https://andreashandel.github.io/IDEMAbook/types-of-infectious-disease-transmission.html) 
and ["Modes of Direct Transmission"](https://andreashandel.github.io/IDEMAbook/modes-of-direct-transmission.html) in IDEMAB.


# Videos 
In this video from the ["Epidemics MOOC"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics), [Marcel Salathe](http://www.digitalepidemiologylab.org/) provides an overview of different types of ID transmission.
