# Topic discussion 

In the paper by Sarah Cobey you read for this module, she states "It is most accurate to describe $R_0$ in reference
to a pathogen and host population, because the number is partially under host control." 

Find examples of this statement by looking through the literature to find - for some pathogen of your choice - at least 2 different estimates for $R_0$. Discuss what factors might affect the differences in reported values. Note that both methodological and biological components can affect $R_0$ estimates.

Report your findings in the Slack _discussion_ channel.
