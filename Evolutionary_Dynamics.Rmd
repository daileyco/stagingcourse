# Overview

In this unit, we will take a look at infectious disease evolution, its relation to control measures and also take a quick glance at emerging infectious diseases and virulence evolution.

# Learning Objectives

* Understand the central mechanisms and drivers of infectious disease evolution
* Be able to assess how different control strategies can affect infectious disease evolution
* Understand how control measures affect pathogen fitness
* Assess the impact of different control measures on potential for evolution



# Reading

Read the chapters _Evolutionary Dynamics Introduction_, _Evolution and Control_ and _Emerging Infectious Diseases_ in IDEMAB. They are not very long and some are still a bit rough, but hopefully readable (as always, contributions/improvements are welcome.)

Optionally, also read the - currently very short - _Virulence_ chapter.


# Videos 

The following videos discuss some aspects of pathogen evolution.


## Overview of ID evolution 

As part of the [Epidemics MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics), [Andrew Read](http://www.thereadgroup.net/) provides a general discussion of pathogen evolution

This is part of a full [TEDEd lesson](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-antibiotics-become-resistant-over-time-kevin-wu).


The following video shows evolution in action in a very clever experimental system

More details on the experiment can be found [in this article published in Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6304/1147).


In this video, [Andrew Read](http://www.thereadgroup.net/) provides a more detailed discussion how drug treatment and evolution interact to lead to resistance, and what we can do to minimize the problem

## Evolution of Virulence

**These videos are optional**

In this video from the  [University of Hong Kong Epidemics course](https://www.edx.org/course/epidemics-hkux-hku01x-0), [Marc Lipsitch](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/marc-lipsitch/) discusses the evolution of pathogens with a special focus on the evolution of virulence.

This video by [Nicole Mideo](http://mideo.eeb.utoronto.ca/) and colleagues provides another explanation of evolution of pathogen virulence.
