## Overview
This unit provides an introduction to the overall idea of studying the dynamics of infectious diseases, why it is useful to take a model-based approach, and what that means. 


# Assignments

_Note: For this and any future modules, you can do the videos and readings in any order. Usually, if there is a paper assigned, it is best to read it last since it often assumes knowledge of material covered in the videos and the reading._

Start by reading the 1st and 2nd chapters of [IDEMAB](https://andreashandel.github.io/IDEMAbook). 


## Examples of model/systems thinking
This video provides a nice introduction to systems thinking, using the example of obesity.

A famous dynamical system model (not from the area of infectious diseases) is Schelling's segregation model. In the following video, [Scott Page](http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/scottepage/) explains and illustrates this model.

This video is part of a course called ["Model Thinking"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking). It is hosted on Coursera and (last I checked), is available for free. I highly recommend the course.


## Models in infectious disease epidemiology
This video is from a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) called ["Epidemics"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics), developed by several infectious disease faculty at Penn State and offered through the MOOC provider Coursera. Matt Ferrari, one of the course instructors, gives a brief discussion of infectious disease models.
