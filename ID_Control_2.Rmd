# Overview

In this module, we revisit infectious disease control and apply it to some more complex scenarios/models, as well as revisit the topic in general.


# Reading

You might still remember most of what you read, but it won't hurt to do another skim-through of the ["Infectious Disease Control" chapter of IDEMAB](https://andreashandel.github.io/IDEMAbook/infectious-disease-control.html).


# Videos

Here are a few more videos that cover various aspects of ID control.

[Marcel Salathe](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/salathelab/) describes non-pharmaceutical ID control interventions applied to prevent healthy individuals from becoming infected.
