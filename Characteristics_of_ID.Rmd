# Overview
In this module, we will discuss how to characterize the infection states of different ID. We will look at this both from a medical perspective and from a public health perspective and discuss how these perspectives complement each other. 


# Assignments

Start by reading the ["Characterizing Infectious Disease States" chapter of IDEMAB](https://andreashandel.github.io/IDEMAbook/idstates.html). 

The book chapter gives you one introduction to a way of classification individuals with regard to infection and disease states. For some further discussions, watch the following videos. 

The first video is from the ["Epidemics"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics) online course. 

[Mary Poss](https://science.psu.edu/bio/people/mup14), one of the course instructors, talks about the difference between infection and disease.

The second video is from the [HKU Epidemics course sequence](https://www.edx.org/search?q=epidemics). 

[Joseph Wu](https://sph.hku.hk/en/about-us/faculty-and-staff/academic-staff/wu,-tsz-kei-joseph) from the University of Hong Kong discusses some quantities relating to infection and disease state and duration and their importance for public health. Ignore anything we haven't covered yet.
